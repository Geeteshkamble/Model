# Sentiment Analysis Project

 **Hindi Conversation Analysis**

   This project analyzes and processes a conversation dataset to detect sentiment using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict the sentiment of the conversation entries.

**What the application does:**

1.Processes conversational data to predict sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)

2.Uses NLP techniques to clean and prepare data

3.Extracts features using TF-IDF

4.Trains an SVM classifier to perform sentiment analysis
