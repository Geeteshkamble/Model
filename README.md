# Sentiment Analysis Project

 **Hindi Conversation Analysis**

   This project analyzes and processes a conversation dataset to detect sentiment using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict the sentiment of the conversation entries.

**What the application does:**

1. Processes conversational data to predict sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)

2. Uses NLP techniques to clean and prepare data

3. Extracts features using TF-IDF

4. Trains an SVM classifier to perform sentiment analysis


**Technologies used:**

1. Python

2. Jupyter Notebook

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

4. Machine Learning

5. scikit-learn
